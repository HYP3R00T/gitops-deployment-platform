# Safe-to-Fail Narrative

Unlike standard portfolio projects that only demonstrate a "happy path," this system is being built to handle failure gracefully.

## The Target: Controlled Failure Scenario

The platform architecture is designed around a **controlled failure scenario**:

1. A developer pushes a commit that intentionally breaks a service health check.
2. The CI/CD pipeline builds the image and updates the GitOps manifest.
3. The reconciliation controller detects the unhealthy deployment and automatically halts or reverts the change.
4. The system restores itself to the last known-good state without manual intervention.

**Current Implementation Status:**

- ✅ Health check endpoints implemented in API service (`services/api/src/api/routes.py`)
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks and validation gates established
- ✅ Local Kubernetes environment (kind) operational
- 🚧 GitOps reconciliation controllers (pending)
- 🚧 Automated rollback mechanisms (pending)
- 🚧 Cloud deployment infrastructure (pending)

???+ warning "Failure readiness"
	The pending GitOps controllers and rollback automation are the critical next steps. Without them, the failure handling described here is aspirational, not yet enforced.

This architecture demonstrates that the platform won't just deploy—it will **validate, react, and recover**.

## Why This Matters

Most infrastructure projects show only success. This project centers on **failure as a first-class concern**.

The ability to fail safely and recover automatically is the real measure of maturity. It separates systems that _happen to work_ from systems that _are designed to work_.
